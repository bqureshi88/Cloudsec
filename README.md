Teksystems Assessment  
## Part 1 Cybersecurity Scenario
Task 1: Threat Intelligence Report
	Types of Attacks
1. SQL Injection: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in SQL queries to manipulate the database.
2. Remote Code Execution (RCE): Exploiting vulnerabilities to run arbitrary code on servers. 
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Attackers trick users into executing unwanted actions.
4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts are injected into web pages to steal user information.
5. File Inclusion (LFI/RFI): Attackers include files to execute malicious code.

	How a Vulnerability Exploited Can Provide Access to the Network:
In an AWS environment, exploiting a vulnerability can give attackers access to EC2 instances or containers running the web application. This access can be used to explore the internal network, steal data, or escalate privileges to other AWS resources like RDS databases, S3 buckets, or IAM roles. For example, an RCE vulnerability could be used to gain shell access to an EC2 instance, allowing the attacker to install malware, capture credentials, and move laterally within the AWS environment.

	 Preventive Measures:
1. Regular Patching and Updates: Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate patching of EC2 instances.
2. Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement strong input validation to prevent injection attacks.
3. Security Testing: Use AWS Inspector to regularly scan for vulnerabilities in EC2 instances.
4. Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy AWS WAF to block malicious traffic targeting web applications.
5. Security Awareness Training: Educate developers and staff on secure coding practices and the importance of applying updates promptly.

Task 2: Incident Response Plan

	Incident Response Plan Outline:
(Assuming the usage of SIEM and CSPM tools, Splunk and Wiz.io in this case due to my personal experience)
1. Preparation
   - Develop an incident response policy.
   - Establish an incident response team with defined roles and responsibilities.
   - Use AWS Security Hub to centralize and manage security alerts.
   - Integrate SIEM and CSPM if available for enhanced visibility and alerting.

2. Identification
   - Detect and identify the breach using AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and Amazon GuardDuty. (Possibly use SIEM and CSPM tools such as Splunk and Wiz.io)
   - Confirm the breach through analysis of logs and alerts from these services.

3. Containment:
   - Short-Term: Isolate affected EC2 instances using security groups and network ACLs.
   - Long-Term: Apply stricter security controls, such as disabling compromised IAM roles and blocking malicious IPs.

4. Eradication
   - Identify and remove the root cause by patching vulnerabilities.
   - Utilize AWS Inspector to scan for and remove malicious code.
   - Use Splunk for forensic analysis and to track the removal of malicious artifacts.

5. Recovery
   - Restore affected systems from clean backups using AWS Backup.
   - Verify system integrity and ensure all instances and services are secure before returning them to production.
   - Conduct a full audit of IAM roles and permissions to ensure no unauthorized access remains.

6. Lessons Learned
   - Conduct a post-incident review to analyze the incident and the effectiveness of the response.
   - Document findings and update the incident response plan based on these insights.
   - Implement additional security measures and policies based on lessons learned to prevent future incidents.

Task 3: Network Security Measures 

	Recommended Network Security Measures:

1. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
   - Amazon GuardDuty: Continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.
   - AWS Shield Advanced: Provides protection against DDoS attacks, offering additional layers of defense.
   - Splunk: Integrate Splunk to analyze and correlate data from multiple sources for advanced threat detection.

2. Firewalls
   - AWS WAF: Protects web applications from common web exploits by allowing you to create custom rules.
   - AWS Network Firewall: Offers stateful, managed network protection to inspect and filter traffic entering and leaving your VPC.

3. Network Segmentation
   - Use AWS VPC to create isolated network segments. (subnets etc.)
   - Implement Security Groups and Network ACLs to control traffic flow between segments, ensuring that only authorized traffic is allowed.
   - Utilize AWS PrivateLink to secure private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises networks.

4. Endpoint Security
   - AWS Systems Manager: Automates patching and configuration management of endpoints.
   - AWS Marketplace: Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions like CrowdStrike or McAfee available in AWS Marketplace.
   - Wiz.io: Monitor and secure cloud workloads and configurations for potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

5. Secure Access Controls
   - AWS IAM: Implement strict access control policies using IAM roles, policies, and permissions.
   - Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users accessing the AWS Management Console and other sensitive services.
   - Use Wiz.io to continuously monitor and enforce compliance with access control policies and Cloud configuration rules.

6. Regular Security Audits and Monitoring
   - Use AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS Config to regularly review your AWS environment for best practices and compliance.
   - Continuously monitor with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time.
   - Integrate Splunk for real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident response capabilities.
   - Use Wiz.io to gain visibility into cloud security posture and automate security checks.

By leveraging these AWS-specific security tools and services, along with Splunk and Wiz.io, the organization can enhance its defense posture, effectively respond to incidents, and mitigate the risk of future security breaches.


## Part 2 Container Security Implementation
Task 1: Docker Security Best Practices
	Docker Security Best Practices:
1. Use Official Images: Always use official and verified Docker images from trusted sources to reduce the risk of using images with known vulnerabilities.

2. Run Containers as Non-Root User: Avoid running containers as the root user to limit the damage that can be done if a container is compromised.

3. Minimize Container Image Size: Use minimal base images and only include necessary components. This reduces the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.

4. Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT): Ensure the integrity and publisher of Docker images by enabling Docker Content Trust, which uses digital signatures.

5. Regularly Update and Scan Images: Frequently update your images and scan them for vulnerabilities using tools like Docker Bench for Security or third-party scanners.

((Example Dockerfile that implements running the container as a Non-Root user is available in the repo))

Task 2: Kubernetes Security Configuration 
	Kubernetes Security Features:
1. Pod Security Policies: Define a set of conditions that a pod must meet to be allowed to run, such as which user it runs as or whether it can mount certain types of volumes.

2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Enforce access controls based on roles assigned to users and service accounts, limiting what actions they can perform within the cluster.

3. Network Policies: Define rules for how pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints, providing a way to isolate and secure network traffic within the cluster.

((Kubernetes YAML Configuration with Security Context pod settings available in repo as Kub.yaml))

Task 3: IaaS Security Measures

Concept of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and its Security Implications:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It allows users to rent virtual servers, storage, and networking capabilities on a pay-as-you-go basis, giving them the flexibility to scale their infrastructure as needed without investing in physical hardware.

Security Implications of IaaS:
1. Shared Responsibility Model: The cloud provider secures the infrastructure, while customers are responsible for securing their data, applications, and configurations. Understanding the division of security responsibilities is crucial for effective security management.

2. Access Control: Ensuring secure access to IaaS resources is vital. Implementing strong authentication mechanisms like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) helps restrict access to sensitive resources.

3. Data Protection: Data security in IaaS involves encryption of data at rest and in transit, proper backup solutions, and managing data integrity and availability.

4. Network Security: Implementing network security measures such as firewalls, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and network segmentation to protect against unauthorized access and attacks.

5. Compliance and Auditing: Regularly auditing the IaaS environment to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations, and using logging and monitoring tools to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
